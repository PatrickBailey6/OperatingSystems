sloppySim <N_Threads> <Sloppiness> <work_time> <work_iterations> <CPU_BOUND> <Do_Logging>

<N_Threads> : Number of created threads
<Sloppiness> : Threshold before global count is updated
<work_time> : Average amount of time each IO takes
<work_iterations> : Amount of times the thread does work
<CPU_BOUND> : true is CPU work, false is simulated IO work
<Do_Logging> : Enable additional debug info
